# Semantic-Segmentation
I developed a solid understanding of deep learning fundamentals, including how neural networks and CNNs work, how to train and evaluate models, and how to approach image segmentation tasks using architectures like U-Net and DeepLabV3+. I also gained practical skills in PyTorch and TensorFlow for building and training deep models.

In addition, I learned about different types of semantic segmentation approaches, including fully convolutional networks (FCNs), encoder-decoder architectures like U-Net, and advanced techniques like Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) used in DeepLabV3+. I explored how these models differ in capturing spatial context, preserving fine-grained details, and improving segmentation accuracy.

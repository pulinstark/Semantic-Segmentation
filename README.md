# Semantic-Segmentation
I developed a solid understanding of deep learning fundamentals, including how neural networks and CNNs work, how to train and evaluate models, and how to approach image segmentation tasks using architectures like U-Net and DeepLabV3+. I also gained practical skills in PyTorch and TensorFlow for building and training deep models.
